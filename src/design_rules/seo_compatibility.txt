# App-Wide Modal + SEO Rules

1. **Every resource/page has a standalone HTML route**

   * Example routes:

     * `/ad/12345-nice-apartment`
     * `/user/67890-profile`
     * `/category/real-estate`
   * Each route must return **SEO-friendly HTML** with `<title>`, `<meta>`, structured data, and full content.
   * This guarantees search engines can index everything and links work without JavaScript.

2. **Main app pages (like `/ads`, `/users`, `/categories`) act as the background context**

   * Clicking on any item should **open it in a modal**, not reload the page.
   * Use `history.pushState` (or router navigation) to update the URL to the standalone route.

3. **Direct visits and reloads**

   * If a user or crawler visits `/resource/[id]` directly:

     * Server renders the full standalone page in HTML.
     * If JavaScript is available, the app should load the parent view in the background (map, list, dashboard, etc.) and **open the modal automatically** with the resource content.

4. **Closing modals & navigation**

   * Closing the modal should return to the parent page (e.g., `/ads`, `/users`).
   * The browser’s back/forward buttons must close or reopen modals accordingly without full reloads.

5. **Progressive enhancement rule**

   * All links must be standard `<a href="/...">` so that:

     * Without JS → links work as normal navigation.
     * With JS → links are intercepted and opened in modals.

6. **Sharing & external access**

   * Any shared link (`/resource/[id]`) must:

     * Open as a modal over the parent page when JS is enabled.
     * Show as a standalone HTML page when JS is disabled.

7. **SEO priority**

   * Crawlers should always get fully rendered HTML for each route.
   * JavaScript enhancements must never hide content from crawlers.

This way, the **entire app behaves like a smooth single-page app with modals**, but still has **clean, crawlable, shareable pages** for SEO.
